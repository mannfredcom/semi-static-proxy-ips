# semi-static-proxy-ips
Lists of semi-static open proxy exit IPs, updated weekly

## Introduction

As a complement to my February 2024 research study titled <a href="https://mannfred.com/open-proxy-life-expectancy/">Open Proxy Life Expectancy</a> a set of CSV files containing semi-static open proxy exit IPs are provided.

| List | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ![proxy_exits_7d_ipv4.csv](https://github.com/mannfredcom/semi-static-proxy-ips/blob/main/proxy_exits_7d_ipv4.csv) | List of open proxy exit IPv4 IPs which have been active for 7 days or longer |
| ![proxy_exits_7d_ipv6.csv](https://github.com/mannfredcom/semi-static-proxy-ips/blob/main/proxy_exits_7d_ipv6.csv) | List of open proxy exit IPv6 IPs which have been active for 7 days or longer |
| ![proxy_exits_30d_ipv4.csv](https://github.com/mannfredcom/semi-static-proxy-ips/blob/main/proxy_exits_30d_ipv4.csv) | List of open proxy exit IPv4 IPs which have been active for 30 days or longer |
| ![proxy_exits_30d_ipv6.csv](https://github.com/mannfredcom/semi-static-proxy-ips/blob/main/proxy_exits_30d_ipv6.csv) | List of open proxy exit IPv6 IPs which have been active for 30 days or longer |

In cases where the exit IP(s) differ(s) from the entry IP the entry information is included in the comment field. Proxy ports and protocols are omitted to reduce the risk of abuse.
